   abstract = {<p>Variable selection is an important step to end up with good prediction models. LASSO regression models are one of the most commonly used methods for this purpose, for which cross‐validation is the most widely applied validation technique to choose the tuning parameter . Validation techniques in a complex survey framework are closely related to “replicate weights”. However, to our knowledge, they have never been used in a LASSO regression context. Applying LASSO regression models to complex survey data could be challenging. The goal of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we analyze the performance of replicate weights methods to select the tuning parameter for fitting LASSO regression models to complex survey data. On the other hand, we propose new replicate weights methods for the same purpose. In particular, we propose a new design‐based cross‐validation method as a combination of the traditional cross‐validation and replicate weights. The performance of all these methods has been analyzed and compared by means of an extensive simulation study to the traditional cross‐validation technique to select the tuning parameter for LASSO regression models. The results suggest a considerable improvement when the new proposal design‐based cross‐validation is used instead of the traditional cross‐validation.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Logistic regression models are widely applied in daily practice. Hence, it is necessary to ensure they have an adequate predictive performance, which is usually estimated by means of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under it (area under the curve [AUC]). Traditional estimators of these parameters are thought to be applied to simple random samples but are not appropriate for complex survey data. The goal of this work is to propose new weighted estimators for the ROC curve and AUC based on sampling weights which, in the context of complex survey data, indicate the number of units that each sampled observation represents in the population. The behaviour of the proposed estimators is evaluated and compared with the traditional unweighted ones by means of a simulation study. Finally, weighted and unweighted ROC curve and AUC estimators are applied to real survey data in order to compare the estimates in a real scenario. The results suggest the use of the weighted estimators proposed in this work in order to obtain unbiassed estimates for the ROC curve and AUC of logistic regression models fitted to complex survey data.</p>},

   abstract = {Special statistical techniques are required to develop valid prediction models for complex survey data. Recently, a weighted estimator has been proposed to estimate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in this context. However, the proposed estimator has shown an optimistic behaviour. Thus, the goal of this work is to analyze the performance of replicate weights methods to correct for the optimism of the AUC in the context of complex survey data.},
