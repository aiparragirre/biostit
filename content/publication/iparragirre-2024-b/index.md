abstract: Special statistical techniques are required to develop valid prediction
  models for complex survey data. Recently, a weighted estimator has been proposed
  to estimate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in this context.
  However, the proposed estimator has shown an optimistic behaviour. Thus, the goal
  of this work is to analyze the performance of replicate weights methods to correct
  for the optimism of the AUC in the context of complex survey data.
