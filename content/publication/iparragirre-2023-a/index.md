abstract: <p>Variable selection is an important step to end up with good prediction
  models. LASSO regression models are one of the most commonly used methods for this
  purpose, for which cross‐validation is the most widely applied validation technique
  to choose the tuning parameter . Validation techniques in a complex survey framework
  are closely related to “replicate weights”. However, to our knowledge, they have
  never been used in a LASSO regression context. Applying LASSO regression models
  to complex survey data could be challenging. The goal of this paper is twofold.
  On the one hand, we analyze the performance of replicate weights methods to select
  the tuning parameter for fitting LASSO regression models to complex survey data.
  On the other hand, we propose new replicate weights methods for the same purpose.
  In particular, we propose a new design‐based cross‐validation method as a combination
  of the traditional cross‐validation and replicate weights. The performance of all
  these methods has been analyzed and compared by means of an extensive simulation
  study to the traditional cross‐validation technique to select the tuning parameter
  for LASSO regression models. The results suggest a considerable improvement when
  the new proposal design‐based cross‐validation is used instead of the traditional
  cross‐validation.</p>
