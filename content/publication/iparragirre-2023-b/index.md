abstract: <p>Logistic regression models are widely applied in daily practice. Hence,
  it is necessary to ensure they have an adequate predictive performance, which is
  usually estimated by means of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
  and the area under it (area under the curve [AUC]). Traditional estimators of these
  parameters are thought to be applied to simple random samples but are not appropriate
  for complex survey data. The goal of this work is to propose new weighted estimators
  for the ROC curve and AUC based on sampling weights which, in the context of complex
  survey data, indicate the number of units that each sampled observation represents
  in the population. The behaviour of the proposed estimators is evaluated and compared
  with the traditional unweighted ones by means of a simulation study. Finally, weighted
  and unweighted ROC curve and AUC estimators are applied to real survey data in order
  to compare the estimates in a real scenario. The results suggest the use of the
  weighted estimators proposed in this work in order to obtain unbiassed estimates
  for the ROC curve and AUC of logistic regression models fitted to complex survey
  data.</p>
