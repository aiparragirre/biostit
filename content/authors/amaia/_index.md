I am a temporary full-time lecturer at the Department of Mathematics of the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), and a member of the research group [MATHMODE](https://www.mathmode.science/). My research focuses on the development and validation of prediction models, in particular, in the context of complex survey data.
